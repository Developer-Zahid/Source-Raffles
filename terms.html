					<h1 class="title mb-4">TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
					<p>Please read these Terms and Conditions (“Terms”, “Terms and Conditions”) carefully before using the <a href="https://sourceraffles.com/" class="link-text">https://dashboard.sourceraffles.com/</a> website or SourceRaﬄes Bot (the “Service”) operated by Source Empire CSD UG (Haftungsbeschränkt) (“us”, “we”, or “our”).</p>
					<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>
					<p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service. The materials contained in this website are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.</p>
					<p>SourceRaffles Bot is a digital product which drastically increases the buyer's possibility to purchase limited edition sneakers. A Discord and 2captcha account is required for this. Upon purchasing you are given access for 30 days, once these 30 days have passed you are then automatically billed for an additional 30 unless you cancel your subscription. You can cancel at any time by A) Logging into your User Dashboard and removing your billing details or B) Emailing contact@sourceraﬄes.com - Your request will be dealt with within 48 hours. Once a license key has been activated it is locked to the Discord account in which it has been activated on. We do not allow the license key to be moved to any other account, under any circumstances. Your SourceRaﬄes Bot subscription starts from the purchase date, and not the activation date. To get the most of your purchase we recommend activating immediately so you can utilise the first full 30 days before the next payment. If your SourceRaﬄes Bot license is paused, or your payment fails, you will be alerted via email so you can restart your membership or update your billing details - You will have 24 hours to do this otherwise your license key will be automatically destroyed, to regain access to SourceRaﬄes Bot you will need to purchase a fresh license key. We do not oﬀer any refunds/returns due to our service being digital-based. We also do not oﬀer support for any third party purchases. We are not liable if you purchase SourceRaﬄes Bot via an unknown source. By purchasing you are accepting these conditions.</p>
					<p>All information collected from the checkout process is used to verify that your order is legitimate and is used via Stripe, our payment processor, to enable us to run a subscription-based product. Source Empire CSD UG (Haftungsbeschränkt) reserve the right to terminate your membership at any time without refund. Inside the Discord server you will find a short list of rules which we require you to follow.</p>
